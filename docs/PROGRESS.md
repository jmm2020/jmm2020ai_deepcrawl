## Known Issues

1. **API Data Transmission**:
   - Issue: API bridge not transmitting complete result data to frontend
   - Impact: Frontend only shows basic progress logs
   - Status: Under investigation
   - Priority: High

2. **Supabase Connection Error**:
   - Error: `'dict' object has no attribute 'headers'`
   - Impact: Database storage doesn't work
   - Workaround: Local JSON file storage is used as fallback
   - Status: Known issue, needs investigation
   - Priority: High

3. **Next.js Port Conflicts**:
   - Error: `listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3112`
   - Impact: Manual termination of processes needed
   - Workaround: Use `npx kill-port 3112` or change port in package.json
   - Status: Known issue, needs automation
   - Priority: Medium

4. **Ollama Model Availability**:
   - Issue: Frontend sometimes fails to load models
   - Impact: Defaults to hardcoded model list
   - Workaround: Restart API bridge or ensure Ollama is running
   - Status: Known issue, needs better error handling
   - Priority: Medium

5. **Embedding Dimension Mismatch**:
   - Issue: Models produce different dimension sizes (1024 vs 1536)
   - Impact: Minimal, auto-padding implemented
   - Solution: Automatic padding to match expected dimensions
   - Status: Resolved with auto-padding
   - Priority: Low

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Sprint)

   - ✅ Analyze failed page structures
   - ✅ Implement specialized content handlers for CLI documentation
   - ✅ Add unit tests for selectors
   - ⚠️ Add more robust retry logic (partially implemented)
   - ⚠️ Enhance error reporting (partially implemented)

2. **Database Reliability**:
   - Debug Supabase connection issues

   - Implement adaptive rate limiting
   - Add request batching
   - Optimize memory usage

### Testing the New JSON Post-Processing Tool

1. **Initial Setup Testing**:
   - Run `cd workbench/scripts && import_json_to_supabase.bat list` to verify file listing functionality
   - Ensure the log directory exists and has appropriate permissions
   - Verify all script paths reference the correct directories

2. **Small-Scale Testing**:
   - Select a small JSON file (under 50 pages) for initial testing
   - Run with default parameters: `import_json_to_supabase.bat results\[small_file].json`
   - Verify success/failure counts in logs
   - Check Supabase database to confirm records were inserted correctly

3. **Parameter Testing**:
   - Test different batch sizes: `import_json_to_supabase.bat results\[file].json 5`
   - Test increased retry counts: `import_json_to_supabase.bat results\[file].json 10 5`
   - Test longer delays: `import_json_to_supabase.bat results\[file].json 10 3 2.0`
   - Document optimal parameters for different scenarios

4. **Large-Scale Testing**:
   - Select a large JSON file (500+ pages) from previous crawls
   - Use optimized parameters based on small-scale testing
   - Monitor system resource usage during import
   - Document throughput rates and success percentages

5. **Duplicate Handling Testing**:
   - Run the same import twice to verify duplicate detection
   - Check logs to ensure duplicates are properly identified and skipped
   - Verify no duplicate records exist in database

6. **Error Recovery Testing**:
   - Intentionally interrupt an import process
   - Restart the import and verify it continues correctly
   - Test the system's ability to recover from network interruptions

7. **Validation Steps**:
   - Query Supabase directly to verify data integrity
   - Test search functionality with imported records
   - Ensure all metadata and embeddings were correctly preserved

### Document the Results

## Historical Issues Resolved

1. ✅ **Crawler Operation**: Core crawler functioning correctly with content extraction
2. ✅ **Embedding Generation**: Functional with 1024 dimensions (auto-padded to 1536)
3. ✅ **API Integration**: Properly integrated with frontend via WebSockets
4. ✅ **Progress Reporting**: Real-time progress updates working
5. ✅ **Error Handling**: Improved error handling and reporting
6. ✅ **Multi-URL Support**: Implemented support for multiple starting URLs
7. ✅ **Parallelization**: Added configurable concurrent request settings
8. ✅ **Sitemap Integration**: Added support for sitemap.xml parsing

## Conclusion

The multi-URL crawling implementation significantly enhances the crawler's capabilities, addressing the limitations noted in previous progress reports regarding the crawler's ability to discover all pages on a website. With parallelization and sitemap integration, the system now provides more comprehensive coverage, better performance, and increased flexibility for different crawling scenarios.
