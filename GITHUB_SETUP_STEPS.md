# GitHub Repository Setup Steps

Before pushing code to GitHub, you need to create the repository on GitHub's website.

## 1. Create the Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/new)
2. Enter repository name: `jmm2020ai_deepcrawl`
3. Add a description (optional): "A comprehensive web crawling, content extraction, and knowledge base creation system with LLM integration."
4. Choose "Public" or "Private" visibility as preferred
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license files (as we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Push Your Code to GitHub

After creating the repository, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# These steps have already been completed:
# git init
# git add .
# git commit -m "Initial commit"
# git remote add origin https://github.com/jmm2020/jmm2020ai_deepcrawl.git
# git branch -M main

# Push the code to GitHub:
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Verify Everything is Working

1. Refresh the GitHub repository page to confirm your code has been pushed
2. Ensure all files and directories appear correctly
3. Verify that GitHub Actions workflows are set up and running

## 4. Create a Development Branch

```bash
git checkout -b dev
git push -u origin dev
```

## 5. Protect Your Branches

On GitHub:
1. Go to repository Settings > Branches
2. Add a branch protection rule for `main`
3. Require pull request reviews before merging
4. Require status checks to pass before merging
5. Save changes

Your repository is now set up and ready for collaborative development!
